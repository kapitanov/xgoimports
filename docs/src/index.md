# xgoimports

A better goimports that keeps your imports sorted and grouped nicely

## Why?

As Go developers we often would like to have our imports grouped by origin:
standard library, then third-party libraries and at last - local packages.
But mainaining this order is a pain, especially when your imports are separated
by empty lines - and auto-importing in IDE is quite notorious to produce such a mess:

```go
// "github.com/myorg/myproject" is mean to be a local package.
import (
    "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg1"

    "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg2"
    "go.uber.org/atomic"

    "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"

    "fmt"
)
```

Here is where `xgoimports` comes in handy:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- With `go fmt` or `goimports`:

    ```go
    // "github.com/myorg/myproject" is mean to be
    // a local package.

    import (
        "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg1"

        "go.uber.org/atomic"

        "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg2"

        "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"

        "fmt"
    )
    ```

    - ‚òπÔ∏è Imports are not grouped by origin, it's a mess!
    - ‚òπÔ∏è Even `goimports -local github.com/myorg/myproject` doesn't help here.

- With `xgoimports`:

    ```go
    // "github.com/myorg/myproject" is mean to be
    // a local package.

    import (
        "fmt"

        "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"
        "go.uber.org/atomic"

        "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg1"
        "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg2"
    )
    ```

    - üòÄ Imports are grouped by origin, so it's much easier to read and maintain.
    - üòÄ Even if (_or when_) an IDE messes up with your imports - `xgoimports` will fix them at once!

## Usage

`xgoimports` is a drop-in replacement for `goimports`, so you can use it in the same way:

```bash
xgoimports -w yourfile.go
```

It's recommmended to use it with `-local` flag to specify your local packages, so they are grouped together:

```bash
xgoimports -local=github.com/yourusername/yourproject -w -format-only yourfile.go
```

Often, you would want to run it on all your Go files in the project:

```bash
xgoimports -local=github.com/yourusername/yourproject -w -format-only $(find . -type f -name '*.go' -not -path "./vendor/*")
```

### Handy snippets

=== "For your scripts"

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    GO_FILES="$(find . -type f -name '*.go' -not -path "./vendor/*")"
    LOCAL_PACKAGES="github.com/yourusername/yourproject"

    goimports -local="$LOCAL_PACKAGES" -w -format-only $GO_FILES
    ```

=== "For your Makefile"

    ```makefile
    GO_FILES       := $(shell find . -type f -name '*.go' -not -path "./vendor/*")
    LOCAL_PACKAGES := github.com/yourusername/yourproject

    format:
        @xgoimports -local=$(LOCAL_PACKAGES) -w -format-only $(GO_FILES)
    ```

=== "For VSCode"

    ```json
    {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "go.formatTool": "custom",
        "go.alternateTools": {
        "customFormatter": "xgoimports"
        },
        "go.formatFlags": [
        "-local=\"github.com/yourusername/yourproject\"",
        "-w",
        "-format-only"
        ]
    }
    ```

### Current limitations

`xgoimports` is unable to properly format imports if there are any comments in the import block.

These import clauses will be left as-is:

```go
// This "import" clause won't be reformatted by xgoimports,
// however, the original behaviour of goimports is preserved.
import (
    "fmt"

    _ "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg2" // Has to be imported for side effects.

    "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"
    "go.uber.org/atomic"

    "github.com/myorg/myproject/subpkg1"
)
```

## Installation

```

### Install from Linix packages

We provide pre-built packages for the most common Linux distributions.
You can install `xgoimports` using the package manager of your distribution.

=== "DEB package (Ubuntu/Debian)"

    ```bash
    export VERSION="0.1.0" # replace with the actual version you want to install
    export ARCH="amd64"    # replace with the actual architecture (amd64, arm64, etc.)
    wget "https://github.com/kapitanov/xgoimports/releases/download/v${VERSION}/xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.deb" \
        -O "xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.deb"
    sudo dpkg -i "xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.deb"
    ```

=== "RPM package (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/AWS Linux)"

    ```bash
    export VERSION="0.1.0" # replace with the actual version you want to install
    export ARCH="amd64"    # replace with the actual architecture (amd64, arm64, etc.)
    wget "https://github.com/kapitanov/xgoimports/releases/download/v${VERSION}/xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.rpm" \
        -O "xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.rpm"
    sudo rpm -i "xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.rpm"
    ```

=== "APK package (Alpine)"

    Run the following commands to install `xgoimports` on Alpine Linux:

    ```bash
    export VERSION="0.1.0" # replace with the actual version you want to install
    export ARCH="amd64"    # replace with the actual architecture (amd64, arm64, etc.)
    wget "https://github.com/kapitanov/xgoimports/releases/download/v${VERSION}/xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.apk" \
        -O "xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.apk"
    sudo apk add --allow-untrusted "xgoimports_v${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.apk"
    ```

### From pre-built binaries (for all platforms)

You can download the latest release of `xgoimports` from the [Releases](https://github.com/kapitanov/xgoimports/releases) page.
Just pick the version you want and the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture.

### From sources (for all platforms)

You can install `xgoimports` via `go get`:

```bash
go install github.com/kapitanov/xgoimports@latest
```

Note that you need to have Go installed on your system to use this method - and you must have the `$GOPATH/bin` in your `PATH`.
Since you most definitely are a Go developer - you are likely to have all these prerequisites already.
